# Partial Translation for Xiaomi BE3600 2.5G Setup (XMiR-Patcher)

This is a partial translation into Ukrainian based on the pre-existing file `data/base.ru.po`.  
The main part remains in Russian. It was created for personal use to avoid relying on a translator during the setup of the Xiaomi BE3600 2.5G.

## Instructions for Use
### Windows
1. Run `run.bat` (or `!START.bat`).  
   *(Optional: If you have changed the default IP address `192.168.31.1`, you will need to update it to match the router's new IP address.)*
2. Run **step 2**.
3. *(Optional: Create a backup using **step 4**.)*
4. Run **step 5**.

### Linux / Mac OS

* Install python 3.8, openssl
* Run `run.sh`

Feel free to modify or extend the translation as needed.
